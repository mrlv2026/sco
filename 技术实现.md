## 解析配置文件
本来通过正则匹配不准群，打算按行分析，参考以下文档

# 以下内容来自上面的网址（FILE FORMAT）
The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the form:

name = value 
The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter.>

Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.

Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim.

Any line beginning with a semicolon (“;”) or a hash (“#”) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace.

Any line ending in a “\” is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.

The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values. Some items such as create masks are numeric.

根据以上内容，我们在解析之前先对文件的内容标准化
# 实现步骤
1. 去除每一行的前面和后面的空格
2. 去除属性行第一个空格的前后空白字符
